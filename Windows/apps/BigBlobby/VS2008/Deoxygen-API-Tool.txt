To see the BigBlobby 0.7 API, double-click on the docs/html/index.html file to 
open the API in a web browser.

The BigBlobby API was generated using the Doxygen tool, which is available 
free at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/.  Prebuilt binaries are available 
for Windows, and the doxywizard graphical front-end is fairly easy to learn.

I happen to prefer using JavaDoc like syntax for the comments to be extracted,
so my comments are wrapped in a banner like the following:

/***************************************************************************//**
Comments written here will be extracted if this banner is right before a
public function, class declaration, or namespace declaration.  See 
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html for more info 
on how to write comments that will be extracted with Doxygen.
