BigBlobby - version 0.7
CCV (Community Core Vision) - version 1.3
Qt framework - version 4.7.3

BigBlobby is intended as a better user interface for the CCV (Community Core 
Vision) blob (fingertip) detection program for multi-touch surfaces.  BigBlobby 
places a GUI (Graphical User Interface) written with the Qt framework in front 
of the existing CCV version 1.3 application for Windows.

The BigBlobby source code is available on a Google Code site:

For programmers who want to modify BigBlobby, the Visual Studio 2008 C++ 
project file, BigBlobby.vcproj, is in the Windows/apps/BigBlobby/VS2008 
directory.  In addition to Visual Studio, the Qt framework version 4.7.3 
(or greater) is required along with the Qt Visual Studio Add-in (available 
free at http://qt-project.org).

The BigBlobby GUI, the CCV program, and the Qt framework are all released
under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1, which should be
in the same directory as this README file.  The GNU LGPL version 2.1 can
also be found at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html.
