#BigBlobby
BigBlobby is intended as a better user interface for the CCV (Community Core 
Vision) blob (fingertip) detection program for multi-touch surfaces.  BigBlobby 
places a GUI (Graphical User Interface) written with the Qt framework in front 
of the existing CCV version 1.3 application for Windows.
